    applications.

    "utf8" (bool, set to true to indicate that characters are Unicode
    characters in UTF8), "chars" (array). Format for the characters in
    "chars":

     [
       [A, b, C, D],  # 0
       [E, F, G],     # 1
       [H, i, J, K],  # 2
       [L, M, N],     # 3
       [O, p, Q, R],  # 4
       [S, t, U, V],  # 5
     ]

     AbbbCbbbD        #0 Top border characters
     E   F   G        #1 Vertical separators for header row
     HiiiJiiiK        #2 Separator between header row and first data row
     L   M   N        #3 Vertical separators for data row
